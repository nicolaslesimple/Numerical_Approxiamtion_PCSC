The method of least squares is a standard approach in regression analysis to the approximate solution of overdetermined systems, i.\+e., sets of equations in which there are more equations than unknowns. This method is a form of mathematical regression analysis that finds the line of best fit for a dataset, providing a visual demonstration of the relationship between the data points. Each point of data is representative of the relationship between a known independent variable and an unknown dependent variable.
